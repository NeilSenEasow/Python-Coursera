Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python script file.
3. Run the script.
4. When prompted, enter the name of the file you want to process.

Upon running, the script will open the specified file, extract timestamps from lines starting with 'From ', calculate the frequency of each hour, sort the counts by hour, and print them.

Details

The script performs the following steps:

1. It prompts the user to enter the name of the file to be processed.
2. It attempts to open the specified file and handles any potential errors such as file not found.
3. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the counts for each hour.
4. It iterates through each line in the file.
5. For each line starting with 'From ', it splits the line into words, extracts the timestamp, and retrieves the hour part.
6. It updates the count for that hour in the dictionary.
7. After processing all lines, it converts the dictionary items into a list of tuples and sorts them by hour.
8. It prints the sorted counts by hour.

Note

Ensure that the specified file exists in the directory from which the script is executed. The script assumes that timestamps are in the format 'From day month time year', where 'time' is in the format 'hour:minute:second'. If the file format differs, the script may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Question

Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
