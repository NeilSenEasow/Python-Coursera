Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python script file.
3. Make sure you have the file "mbox-short.txt" available in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script.

Upon running, the script will analyze the email data from "mbox-short.txt" and print the sender with the highest message count.

Details

The script performs the following steps:

1. It initializes an empty dictionary to store sender email addresses and their corresponding message counts.
2. It opens the file "mbox-short.txt" in read mode.
3. It iterates through each line in the file.
4. For each line that starts with 'From ', it extracts the sender's email address (considered as the second word in the line) and updates its count in the dictionary.
5. After processing all lines, it iterates through the dictionary to find the sender with the highest message count.
6. It prints the email address of the sender with the highest message count along with the count itself.

Note

Ensure that the file "mbox-short.txt" exists in the same directory as the script. This script assumes that the email data follows a specific format where each line starting with 'From ' contains the sender's email address as the second word. If the file format differs, the script may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Question

Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
